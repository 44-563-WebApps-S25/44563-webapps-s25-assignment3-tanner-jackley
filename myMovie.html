            <p>
                My favorite movie is Spider-Man: No Way Home. This is my favorite 
                movie because Spider-Man is my favorite superhero, and Tom Holland is 
                my favorite spiderman, and this is the best movie out of the three that 
                Tom Holland currently has. This movie has an engaging plot, and it is 
                super cool how the movie brings in Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and 
                each of their villains. Overall, I just really enjoy this movie and 
                could watch it over and over again.

                besides Tom Hollond.
